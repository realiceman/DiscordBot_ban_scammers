Discord Bot that can be deployed on your discord server and be used to ban scammers publishing phishing links and scam ads.

You can arrange the code as you wishes and deploy it anywhere. Make sure to handle the env file properly into the code or into the environment, before deployment. I personally use replit.com to host my bot, and in replit.com you can have secrets and call them into your code by keeping the same syntax "os.environ.get('XXX')" so handling the bot.env file would be no longer necessary. Also I use uptimerobot.com in order to ping the app and check if the bot is alive.
